<p>&quot;I met Dan right at the start of the Mum&amp;You journey and immediately felt that MarketplacePower was the right partner to build the Amazon business. Their skills and experience helped us every step of the way which as you&apos;ll find out can be extremely complex. From guidance in terms of the channels possible on Amazon, the FBA setup process, assortment advice, creating top class product detail pages, promotional strategy, customer interaction software and setup, to kick starting the sales with in depth knowledge of setting up sponsored product campaigns, Dan's been hands on throughout the journey.  But much more than their skills, I love their attitude. Dan treats it like his business and is as passionate about it as any of the Mum&amp;You team. He is completely hands on and never out of reach. You can depend on him&quot; <br><strong class="highlight-green">Rajiv Chandra, Mum &amp; You Founder</strong></p>
