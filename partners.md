<p>&quot;I met Dan right at the start of the Mum&You journey in February 2018, and immediately he was the right partner to build the Amazon business. At the outset Dan was able to give me and the wider Mum & You team a comprehensive introduction to Amazon as both a retail channel and media platform, which as you'll find out can be extremely complex. Dan’s skills and experience help us every step of the way, not just in the setup process but also as our sales grow. Dan's been hands on throughout the journey - he clearly presents the options available to us and makes sound recommendations. Initially for example with which particular channel we’d opt for on Amazon and why that was best for M&Y, which marketing to invest in, how to elevate the product and brand within the amazon ecosystem, our operational setup etc. Dan continues to keep us updated with the latest programs Amazon has for sellers- FBA subscribe and save for example where we now have thousands of subscriptions to Mum & You products. One of our biggest successes are our biodegradable baby wipes, which are now in the top 10 selling products in the entire Baby category, with over 200 reviews, 4.5 stars on average and are “Amazon’s Choice” for “biodegradable wipes”. We continue to see triple digit growth and are on track to ship Mum & You products to over 100,000 Amazon customers in 2019 – a remarkable achievement in just over 18 months since launch. But much more than Dan’s skills, I love his attitude. Dan treats Mum & You like his business and is as passionate about it as any of the Mum&You team. He is completely hands on and never out of reach. You can depend on him and MarketplacePower.&quot; <br><strong class="highlight-green">Rajiv Chandra, Mum &amp; You Founder</strong></p>
